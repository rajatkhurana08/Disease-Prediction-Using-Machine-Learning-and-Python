<h1>Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>
This project implements a machine learning-based disease prediction system that analyzes patient symptoms and medical history to predict the likelihood of various diseases. The objective is to aid early diagnosis and improve patient care by leveraging data-driven insights.

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Predicts risk for multiple diseases using classifiers such as logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.</li>
  <li>Takes user medical data and symptoms as input.</li>
  <li>Provides a confidence score for each prediction.</li>
  <li>Compares model performance via metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall.</li>
  <li>Optionally provides home remedy suggestions and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</li>
</ul>
